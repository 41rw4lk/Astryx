## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you believe you’ve found a security issue, please do one of the following:
- Open a GitHub issue with a clear description and reproduction steps (do not include sensitive data), or
- If it’s sensitive, contact me privately (preferred) and I’ll respond as soon as possible.

## Notes
- The Web UI is intended to run locally and bind to loopback (127.0.0.1). Do not expose it to the internet.
- Your local configuration files (if present) may contain preferences and should not be shared.
